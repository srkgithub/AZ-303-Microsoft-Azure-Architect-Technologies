# Lab: Implementing Highly Available Azure IaaS Compute Architecture
# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario
  
Adatum Corporation has several on-premises workloads running on a mix of physical servers and virtual machines. Most of the workloads require some level of resiliency, including a range of high availability SLAs. Most of the workloads leverage either Windows Server Failover Clustering or Linux Corosync clusters and Pacemaker resource manager, with synchronous replication between cluster nodes. Adatum is trying to determine how the equivalent functionality can be implemented in Azure. In particular, the Adatum Enterprise Architecture team is exploring the Azure platform capabilities that accommodate high availability requirements within the same data center and between data centers in the same region.

In addition, the Adatum Enterprise Architecture team realizes that resiliency alone might not be sufficient to provide the level of availability expected by its business operations. Some of the workloads have highly dynamic usage patterns, which are currently addressed based on continuous monitoring and custom scripting solutions, automatically provisioning and deprovisioning additional cluster nodes. Usage patterns of others are more predictable, but also need to be occasionally adjusted to account for increase demand for disk space, memory, or processing resources.

To accomplish these objectives, the Architecture team wants to test a range of highly available IaaS compute deployments, including:

-  Availability sets-based deployment of Azure VMs behind an Azure Load Balancer Basic

-  Zone-redundant deployment of Azure VMs behind an Azure Load Balancer Standard

-  Zone-redundant deployment of Azure VM scale sets behind an Azure Application Gateway

-  Automatic horizontal scaling of Azure VM scale sets (autoscaling) 

-  Manual vertical scaling (compute and storage) of Azure VM scale sets

An availability set represents a logical grouping of Azure VMs which controls their physical placement within the same Azure datacenter. Azure makes sure that the VMs within the same availability set run across multiple physical servers, compute racks, storage units, and network switches. If a hardware or software failure happens, only a subset of your VMs are impacted and your overall solution stays operational. Availability Sets are essential for building reliable cloud solutions. With availability sets, Azure offers 99.95% VM uptime SLA.

Availability zones represent unique physical locations within a single Azure region. Each zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. The physical separation of availability zones within a region protects applications and data from datacenter failures. Zone-redundant services replicate your applications and data across availability zones to protect from single-points-of-failure. With availability zones, Azure offers 99.99% VM uptime SLA.

Azure virtual machine scale sets let you create and manage a group of identical, load balanced VMs. The number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease in response to demand or a defined schedule. Scale sets provide high availability to your applications, and allow you to centrally manage, configure, and update many VMs. With virtual machine scale sets, you can build large-scale services for areas such as compute, big data, and container workloads.

## Objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

-  Describe characteristics of highly available Azure VMs residing in the same availability set behind a Azure Load Balancer Basic

-  Describe characteristics of highly available Azure VMs residing in different availability zones behind an Azure Load Balancer Standard

-  Describe characteristics of automatic horizontal scaling of Azure VM Scale Sets

-  Describe characteristics of manual vertical scaling of Azure VM Scale Sets

1. In the toolbar of the Cloud Shell pane, select the **Upload/Download files** icon, in the drop-down menu select **Upload**, and upload the file **\\\\AZ303\\AllFiles\\Labs\\05\\azuredeploy30305subc.json** into the Cloud Shell home directory.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create a resource groups (replace the `<Azure region>` placeholder with the name of the Azure region that is available in your subscription and which is closest to the location of your lab computer):

   ```Bash
   az deployment sub create --location '<Azure region>' --template-file azuredeploy30305subc.json --parameters rgName=az30305c-labRG rgLocation='<Azure region>'
   ```

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, upload the Azure Resource Manager template **\\\\AZ303\\AllFiles\\Labs\\05\\azuredeploy30305rgc.json**.

1. In the Cloud Shell pane and, in the Bash session within the Cloud Shell pane, open the **azuredeploy30305rgc.json** file in your preferred text editor.

1. In the editor window displaying the content of the **azuredeploy30305rgc.json** file, in the following section, replace the asterisk in the line `"sourceAddressPrefix": "*",` with the public IP address you recorded earlier in this lab, save the change, and close the file:

   ```json
          {
            "name": "custom-allow-rdp",
            "properties": {
              "priority": 1000,
              "sourceAddressPrefix": "*",
              "protocol": "Tcp",

          },
   ```

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, upload the Azure Resource Manager parameter file **\\\\AZ303\\AllFiles\\Labs\\05\\azuredeploy30305rgc.parameters.json**.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to deploy an Azure Application Gateway with its backend pool consisting of a pair of Azure VMs hosting Windows Server 2019 Datacenter Core across different availability zones (replace the `<vm_Size>` placeholder with the size of the Azure VM you intend to use for this deployment, such as `Standard_D2s_v3`):

   ```
   az deployment group create --resource-group az30305c-labRG --template-file azuredeploy30305rgc.json --parameters @azuredeploy30305rgc.parameters.json vmSize= <vm_Size>
   ```

    > **Note**: Wait for the deployment to complete before proceeding to the next task. This should take about 10 minutes.

1. In the Azure portal, close the Cloud Shell pane. 


#### Task 2: Analyze a highly available Azure VM Scale Set deployed across availability zones behind an Azure Application Gateway

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Network Watcher** and, on the **Network Watcher** blade, select **Topology**.

1. On the **Network Watcher \| Topology** blade, specify the following settings:

    | Setting | Value | 
    | --- | --- |
    | Subscription | the name of the Azure subscription you are using in this lab |
    | Resource Group | **az30305c-labRG** |
    | Virtual Network | **az30305c-vnet** |

1. Review the resulting topology diagram, noting the connections between the public IP address, load balancer, and the network adapters of Azure VM instances in the Azure Virtual Machine Scale Set in its backend pool. 

    > **Note**: In addition, deployment of an Azure Application Gateway requires a dedicated subnet, included in the diagram (although the gateway is not displayed).

    > **Note**: In this configuration, it is not possible to use Network Watcher to view the effective network security rules (that is one of distinctions between Azure VMs and instances of an Azure VM Scale Set). Similarly, you cannot rely on using **Connection troubleshoot** to test network connectivity from Azure VM Scale Set instances, although it is possible to use it to test connectivity from the Azure Application Gateway.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **az30305c-labRG** resource group blade, in the list of resources, and select the **az30305c-vmss** virtual machine scale set entry. 

1. On the **az30305c-vmss** blade, note the **Location** and **Fault domains** entries. 

    > **Note**: Unlike Azure VMs, individual instances of Azure VM scale sets deploy into separate fault domains, including instances deployed into the same zone. In addition, they support 5 fault domains (unlike Azure VMs, which can use up to 3 fault domains). 

1. On the **az30305c-vmss** blade, select **Instances**, on the **az30305c-vmss \| Instances** blade, select the first instance, and identify its availability zone by reviewing the value of the **Location** property. 

1. Navigate back to the **az30305c-vmss \| Instances** blade, select the second instance, and identify its availability zone by reviewing the value of the **Location** property. 

    > **Note**: Verify that each instance resides in a different availability zone.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **az30305c-labRG** resource group blade and, in the list of resources, select the **az30305c-appgw** load balancer entry, and on the **az30305c-appgw** blade, note the public IP address entry.

1. In the Azure portal, start a new **Bash** session in the Cloud Shell pane. 

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to test load balancing of HTTP traffic to the Azure VM Scale Set instances in the backend pool of the Azure Application Gateway (replace the `<lb_IP_address>` placeholder with the IP address of the front end of the gateway you identified earlier):

   ```Bash
   for i in {1..4}; do curl <appgw_IPaddress>; done
   ```

    > **Note**: Verify that the returned messages indicate that the requests are being delivered in the round robin manner to the backend Azure VMs

1. On the **az30305c-appgw** blade, select the **HTTP settings** entry and, on the **az30305c-appgw \| HTTP settings** blade, select the **appGwBackentHttpSettings** entry representing the load balancing rule handling HTTP traffic. 

1. On the **appGwBackentHttpSettings** blade, review the existing settings without making any changes and note that you can enable **Cookie-based affinity**.

    > **Note**: This feature requires that the client supports the use of cookies.

    > **Note**: You cannot use Azure Application Gateway to implement NAT for RDP connectivity to instances of an Azure VM Scale Set. Azure Application Gateway supports only HTTP/HTTPS traffic.


### Exercise 4: Implementing autoscaling of Azure VM Scale Sets using availability zones and Azure Application Gateway.
  
The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

   for (( ; ; )); do curl -s <lb_IP_address>?[1-10]; done
   ```
1. In the Azure portal, on the **az30305c-vmss** Overview blade, on the Monitoring tab, review the **CPU (average)** chart and verify that the CPU utilization of the Application Gateway increased sufficiently to trigger scaling out.

    > **Note**: You might need to wait a few minutes.

1. On the **az30305c-vmss** blade, select the **Instances** entry and verify that the number of instances has increased.

    > **Note**: You might need to refresh the **az30305c-vmss \| Instances** blade.

    > **Note**: You might see the number of instances increasing by 2 (rather than 1). This is expected as long as the final number of running instances is 3. 

1. In the Azure portal, close the **Cloud Shell** pane. 

1. In the Azure portal, on the **az30305c-vmss** blade, review the **CPU (average)** chart and verify that the CPU utilization of the Application Gateway decreased sufficiently to trigger scaling in. 

    > **Note**: You might need to wait a few minutes.

1. On the **az30305c-vmss** blade, select the **Instances** entry and verify that the number of instances has decreased to 2.

    > **Note**: You might need to refresh the **az30305c-vmss \| Instances** blade.
